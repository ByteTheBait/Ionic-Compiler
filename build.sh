# Build the Ionic compiler from the split source tree.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh                       — build ionic_new using ionic_self
#                                       (the committed bootstrap binary that
#                                        ships with the repo). Works on any
#                                        OS without any toolchain installed.
#   ./build.sh --verify-self-hosting — build ionic_new, then confirm that
#                                       ./ionic_self and the freshly-built
#                                       self-hosted compiler emit an identical
#                                       object file for the same sources.
#                                       Compares .o (not the linked binary,
#                                       which the linker always stamps with a
#                                       fresh UUID/signature). Exits 0 on
#                                       match, 1 otherwise.
#   IONIC=./some_binary ./build.sh   — use a specific Ionic binary instead of
#                                       the default ./ionic_self
#
# End users install the released tarball (./ionic + lib/std). To rebuild from
# source they just need ./ionic_self from the same tarball; no toolchain
# required.
#
# The Rust source tree (src/*.rs + Cargo.toml) is for the dev-only Rust
# compiler. It's used by CI as a cross-OS bootstrap — `cargo build --release`
# produces target/release/ionic which can compile user programs on any OS
# without needing the committed ionic_self. But target/release/ionic is
# missing bitwise operator support (it predates that addition), so it
# CANNOT compile the split .ionic sources themselves — use ionic_self for
# that. End users don't need Rust or cargo; releases ship self-hosted.

# ── Mode: build then verify self-hosting ────────────────────────────────────
# The compiler writes its object next to the output as "<out>.o", then shells
# out to `clang` to link it. Comparing the *linked binaries* can never match:
# the linker stamps each output with a fresh LC_UUID and an ad-hoc
# LC_CODE_SIGNATURE, so byte-identity is impossible even for identical input.
# We therefore compare the compiler-generated .o files, which ARE deterministic
# and are exactly what this project owns.
#
#   1. $IONIC compiles the sources → capture its .o as A
#   2. $OUT (freshly built) compiles the same sources → capture its .o as B
#   3. A must equal B: the bootstrap and the self-hosted compiler agree.
